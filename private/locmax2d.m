function fImg=locmax2d(img,mask,keepFlat)
%LOCALMAX searches for local maxima in an image
%
%    SYNOPSIS fImg=(img,mask)
%
%    INPUT    img    image matrix
%             mask   [m n] defines the operator window dimensions
%             keepFlat Optional input variable to choose whether to remove
%                      "flat" maxima or to keep them. Default is 0, to
%                      remove them. - KJ
%
%    OUTPUT   fImg   map with all the local maxima (zeros elsewhere);
%                    the non-zero values contain the original value 
%                    of the image at that place
