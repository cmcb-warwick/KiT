function gauss=GaussMask2D(sigma,fSze,cent,cnorm,absCenter)
% GaussMask2D	create a gaussian 2D mask
%
%    SYNOPSIS gauss =GaussMask3D(sigma,fSze,cent,cnorm,absCenter);
%
%    INPUT: sigma  of gauss mask [sigmaX sigmaY] or [sigma]. 
%                  If scalar, sigma will be the same for all dimensions
%           fSze   size of the gauss mask [sizeX sizeY] or [size]
%                  If scalar, size will be the same for all dimensions.
%                  (odd size required for symmetric mask!)
%           cent   (optional)2D vector with center position [0 0] is
%                  center of fSze (default=[0 0])
%                  if absCenter = 1, center position is measured from
%                  [0,0] in matrix coordinates (which is outside of the
%                  array by half a pixel!)
%           cnorm  (optional) select normalization method:
%                  =0 (default) no normalization - max of gauss will be 1
%                  =1 norm so that integral over pixels will be exactly 1
%                  =2 norm so that integral of an infinite Gauss would be 1
%           absCenter (optional) select the type of center vector
%                  =0 (default). Zero is at center of array
%                  =1 Zero is at [0,0] in matrix coordinates, which is
%                  outside of the array by half a pixel!
%                      (center of top left pixel of 2-D matrix = [1,1])
%
%
%    OUTPUT: gauss   2D gaussian intensity distribution with pixel values
%                    equal to the integral of the gauss over the area of
%                    the pixel
